## Issue
The bitwarden extension does not load when I open it in Firefox Private Browsing so I am unable to auto-fill forms.

## Workaround
1. Navigate to the website's login page
2. Right click the page
    - A context menu will appear
3. Select **bitwarden > Auto-fill > The website**
    - If **Vault is locked.** appears, unlock the browser extension from a non-private Firefox window
