## Issue
The bitwarden extension does not load when I open it in Firefox Private Browsing so I am unable to auto-fill forms.

## Workaround
If the bitwarden extension is locked (little red lock icon), unlock it in a non-private Firefox window before proceeding.
1. Navigate to the website's login page in Firefox Private Browsing
2. Right click the page
    - A context menu will appear
3. Select **bitwarden > Auto-fill > the website**
